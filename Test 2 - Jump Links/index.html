                            <h3>Japan</h3>
                            <p>I went to Japan on my honeymoon in 2019, it's somewhere I had always wanted to go and we thought this would be the perfect time to go. So I packed my suitcase, my limited conversational Japanese, and my brand new wife and went on a whirlwind tour of the country. We started off in Tokyo, went through numerous little mountain towns, then on to Kyoto for the end of our trip. To this day, it remains the best holiday I've been on</p>

                            <p>Iceland has always been on the bucket list for the fact that it's known for views of the Northern Lights. With that in mind, in the second half of October, my wife and I jetted off to Iceland. I was not prepared for how beautiful the country was, and would highly recommend it to anyone as the perfect week-long break.</p>

                            <p>Before going to Iceland, known for its cold climate, we decided that we'd go somewhere known for its warmer climate. The first half of this holiday was up in the mountains on the border between Italy and Switzerland. If I could have stayed here forever, I would have. A log cabin, up in the mountains, no TV, a firepit and a group full of my favourite people? Nothing better.</p>

                            <p>This was my first big holiday I'd ever been on. In keeping with my geeky personality, of course the chief reason my wife and I went was to go to an anime / gaming convention being held in Baltimore. After the convention we headed out on a bus from Baltimore to New York and I felt like I was in a movie the whole time I was there. It's just like a different world out there.</p>

                            <p>As my homeland, Ireland will always hold a special place in my heart. While I was living there, I did a lot of local tourism, but home is where the heart is, and I always enjoyed coming home to the town I grew up in. This is even more so now that I reside in the UK. I go home now and again now for a breath of fresh air and I always come back feeling refreshed.</p>
